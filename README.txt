The i-kaktusss is an....
.... iambic keyer and koch trainer using a seventeen segment screen.

The keyer was presented in the May 2013 edition of Amateur Radio, the monthly
magazine of the Wireless Institute of Australia

The keyer can be used as:

- an iambic keyer with a set of morse paddles
- a beacon, playing stored morse
- pseudo random morse code generation
- and playback of stored text for learning morse
- play and display morse characters entered on a PS/2 keyboard
- koch style training (in development)
- and anything else you care to program it to do

all with configurable WPM and farnsworth spacing.


PicAXE28x2 version:

The menu button allows the various modes to be selected, and keeping the
menu button depressed while hitting the dit or dah paddles allows the
WPM to be changed.

The PicAXE version of the i-kaktusss uses a PicAXE 28x2 to drive the LED
display, play morse code, and perform the iambic keying and interpreting of
the keyed morse.

The PCB has been designed to support prototyping and customisation.

Kits are currently available from http://www.aztronics.com.au

Over time, the google code git repository will be populated with the
necessary design files for those wishing to build their own.

The PCB was designed with the FOSS gEDA suite of design tools under
Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

The BASIC code was written with the Revolution Education PicAXE development
tools, which are available for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, and are
needed to download the code to the PicAXE 28x2.


Atmega version:

An AVR version of the i-kaktusss is currently being developed.

This will allow radio amateurs, schools, scouts and educational institutions
to select their preferred training platform and development environment.
